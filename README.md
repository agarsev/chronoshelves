Chronoshelves
=============
"Chronoshelves" is an interactive display and quizz of chronological data.

Time units are represented by named and colored drawers, which can be dragged
around. Time is represented (not to scale) as shelving, where shelves on top of
one another represent consecutive time periods. There can also be vertical
shelves to the left, which represent "macro" units, containing an arbitrary (and
possibly nested) number of subdivisions.

The drawers start in random positions outside the shelves, and the user has to
drag and drop them in the correct place. A score can then be computed, and
incorrectly placed drawers marked.
